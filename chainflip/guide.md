# Chainflip Node Installation Guide

Prerequisites

- metamask wallet;
- Goerli testnet + Goerli testnet tokens;
- add this token address to the metamsk.

You'll need two Ethereum Accounts:  the first one (we will refer to it as your Wallet/Account) will be used for receiving tFLIP from the Faucet and Interacting with the Staking App to stake and withdraw funds and the second one (we will refer to it as the Validator Wallet/Account) will be used by the validator to send transactions to the Goerli Ethereum blockchain.
